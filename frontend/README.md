# Frontend (Day 5)

This is a minimal Vite + React skeleton used as a simple dashboard for Proof Train Oracle. It uses static mock JSON files under `/mock/` to emulate backend endpoints.

To run locally (if you have Node.js installed):

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
